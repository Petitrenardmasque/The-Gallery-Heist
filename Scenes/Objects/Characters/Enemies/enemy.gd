class_name Enemy
extends "res://Scenes/Objects/Characters/character.gd"

# enemies are named based on their behavior rather than type
# a "patroling" enemy may have different skins for different areas but always
# the same behavior. in the future we can have a "skin" or "type"
# that changes the visuals of each enemy
